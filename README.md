I'm an undergraduate researcher exploring the intersection of <strong>machine learning, **economics**, and **information systems**. My research focuses on modeling how qualitative information interacts with market dynamics and how these relationships can be quantified through AI-driven models.
<br><br>
I currently lead research and development at **Abstractive Labs**, where we're building the intelligence layer of the modern worldâ€”systems that remember and reason in real time.<br><br>

## Recent Works

At <a href="https://abstractive.me" target="_blank"><strong>Abstractive Labs</strong></a>, my R&D focus is on building the intelligence layer of the modern world. We're designing the neural substrate for financial and informational intelligence, focusing on building the neural substrate for reinforcement learning for real-time decision-making agents. 

- &nbsp; **Research Interests:** Reinforcement learning, NLP, continual learning, and dynamic knowledge graphs.
- &nbsp; **Ask me about:** Python, PyTorch, system architecture, reasoning engines and quantitative modeling.
