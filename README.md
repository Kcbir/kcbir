## 🚀 What I'm Currently Building

At <a href="https://abstractive.me" target="_blank"><strong>Abstractive Labs</strong></a>, my R&D focus is on building the intelligence layer of the modern world. We're designing the neural substrate for financial and informational intelligence, focusing on:

* 🧠 &nbsp; **Dynamic Knowledge Graphs:** Real-time causal mapping of global events.
* 📈 &nbsp; **Continual Learning Pipelines:** Building systems that learn from new information without forgetting the old.
* 🤖 &nbsp; **Reasoning Engines:** Giving AI agents the memory and temporal context they lack.
* 💹 &nbsp; **AGI for Trading:** Researching reinforcement learning for real-time decision-making agents.

- &nbsp; **Current Focus:** Building the neural substrate for financial intelligence, focusing on dynamic knowledge graphs, continual learning, and AGI for trading agents.
- &nbsp; **Research Interests:** Reinforcement learning, NLP, continual learning, and dynamic knowledge graphs.
- &nbsp; **Ask me about:** Python, PyTorch, system architecture, and quantitative modeling.

### Hi, I'm Kabir 👋

I'm an undergraduate researcher exploring the intersection of **machine learning**, **economics**, and **information systems**. My research focuses on modeling how qualitative information interacts with market dynamics and how these relationships can be quantified through AI-driven models.

I currently lead research and development at **Abstractive Labs**, where we're building the intelligence layer of the modern world—systems that remember and reason in real time.
